	Let's hope that I won't abandon this project like I've done with thousand
	others.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
	This site is built using a static site generator (SSG) which I haven't
	released yet. Heck I didn't even named it yet.
</p>
<p>
	The SSG is built using posix bash
	<strike>and can convert markdown into html</strike>. It used to support
	markdown but i decided to use plain html now. Before releasing this to
	public, I'm gonna implement various features like sitemap creation, search
	indexing, thumbnail resizer and SPA etc.
</p>
<p>And of course I have to think of a name too.</p>
<p>
	The site template <strike>itself uses no js</strike> uses less than 1kb js
	for syntax highlighting and every line of css is hand-written.
</p>
<p>The design of the site will keep on improving and so will the SSG</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
	I created this site as a public devlog / personal diary. I don't have much
	expectations from this but I guess I'll see where this goes.
