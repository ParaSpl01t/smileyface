<h2>Extensions are useful</h2>
<p>
	Just want to point this out first. Extensions makes the time I spend
	browsing less miserable. From removing useless features in Google search to
	bringing back the dislike count, there's an extension for everything.
</p>
<p>
	But still some extension developer just want to make my already pathetic
	life more pathetic. Which brings me to my second point.
</p>
<h2>Extensions are fucking annoying</h2>
<p>
	Please tell me why the fuck I need a welcome screen when I installed a
	fucking extension? why the fuck do you need to show me the damn changelogs
	on every update which I don't give a shit about?
	<i>looking at you Wappalyzer..</i>
</p>
<p>
	A new tab is something that must be initiated on user's wish. This is
	something that a user controls and it should stay that way.
</p>
<p>
	I just recently logged in to my chrome profile to get my extensions and
	bookmarks back. Almost 8 extensions decided to bomb the shit out of
	miserable laptop by showing their own shitty little welcome screen, in
	seperate tabs.
</p>
<p>
	Every fucking time I want to concentrate and do some research. Some peice of
	shit extension decides to show me the update changelogs. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
	ABOUT YOUR CHANGELOGS, MOTHERFUCKER!!.
</p>
<p>
	And everytime I fucking uninstall some shitty extension.. BOOM! fucking
	survey page. This horseshit make me so fucking pissed, that sometimes I wish
	to shit in the dev's mouth.
</p>
<p>
	I might be overreacting. But there are pleny non-obtrusive way to welcome
	your users, collect feedback or to show the damn changelogs.
</p>
<p>
	I wish that browser provide a permission system to whitelist or "one time
	allow" the extension to open new tabs.
