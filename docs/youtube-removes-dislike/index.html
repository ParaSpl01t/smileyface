<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>
	Our lord and saviour YouTube decided to hide the dislike count on all
	videos. They did this to "reduce dislike attacks and protect their creators
	from harassement".
</p>
<p>
	To be fair, dislike attacks and harassement are valid issues that needs
	attention. But was this the only way to tackle these issues?
</p>
<p>
	This change is almost rolled out globally, and looks like YouTube doesn't
	intend to roll back this shitty change despite the community protest.
</p>
<h2>Really tho?</h2>
<p>
	Excuse my french but.. I fucking refuse to believe that "protecting
	creators" is Google's entire motivation. There are more serious issues that
	makes this platform suck balls but YouTube doesn't give a shit.
</p>
<p>Some major issues :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spam</li>
	<li>Scams in videos and comments</li>
	<li>Harassement of viewers in comments</li>
	<li>Misinformation</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Don't fucking tell me that Google ignored these problem, but decided to
	remove one of the most useful feature of the platform.
</p>
<p>
	Oh Google you disgusting fuck, you really thought that you can wrap your
	stinky shit in brown sugar, and sell it as a chocolate cake?
</p>
<h2>The real truth</h2>
<p>
	This change even fails to do what youtube claims it does. Creators still can
	see the fucking dislike count on their dashboard. So, what's the fucking
	point?
</p>
<p>
	And the primary source of harassement is the comment section, not the
	dislike button. So what are you gonna do now Google? Remove the fucking
	comments too?
</p>
<p>
	YouTube is obviously trying to follow in the footsteps of other major online
	media gaints like:- instagram, tiktok and twitch. Removing the dislikes will
	only make the platform more advertiser friendly reather than creator
	friendly.
</p>
<h2>How this affects viewers</h2>
<p>
	One day, you're just chilling on the couch wondering what a patethic loser
	you are. Then you remembered that you bought a nice peice of walnut wood and
	some parts to build yourself a desk last month. But you never decided to put
	the effort into building the table because you're a lazy peice of shit.
</p>
<p>
	For once in your life, you decided to do something productive. You go to
	youtube, search "DIY desk" and scroll up untill you find a good looking desk
	on the thumbnail.
</p>
<p>
	You open the video and notice more dislikes than likes. At this point, you
	know you'll end up nailing your dick on the fucking table top if you decided
	to follow the video.
</p>
<p>
	Same goes for every educational / DIY / informative content on youtube.
	You'll need to know the dislike count to determine weather watching the
	video is worth your time.
</p>
<h2>The solution for viewers</h2>
<p>
	In short, someone had enough of this shit and decided to take the matter in
	their own hands. Simply visit
	<a target="_blank" href="https://returnyoutubedislike.com/"
		>https://returnyoutubedislike.com/</a
	>
	and install the extension in your browser and you'll get dislikes back.
</p>
<p>
	Also I recommend watching
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz9b0oJw69I" target="_blank"
		>this video</a
	>
	to get the better idea of what the fuck is going on.
