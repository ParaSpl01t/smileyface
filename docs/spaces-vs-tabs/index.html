<h2>The difference</h2>
<p>
	Spaces and tabs are similar in a way. "but how?" you might ask. They both
	suck that's how.
</p>
<h2>The problem with spaces.</h2>
<p>
	Let's talk tabs first. Suppose there are two developers working on a same
	git project, Terry and Felix.
	<i
		>("T" in Terry stands for <b>TWO</b> and "F" in Felix stands for
		<b>FOUR</b>)</i
	>
</p>
<p>
	Terry creates a github repo and all the code uses tabs as indentation (size:
	2). Felix notices some bugs and decides to contribute. He forks it, Indents
	with tabs(size : 4), makes some changes and submits a PR.
</p>
<p>
	Now tab size doesn't matter if you're indenting with tabs. Terry reviews the
	code and merges it. Boom! HAPPY FUCKING ENDING.
</p>
<p>
	Now suppose they both start to indent with spaces for some reason. This time
	Terry creates a repo with all the code using 2 spaces for indentation. Felix
	forkes it, makes some changes and submits a PR. Now Terry will review the
	code and merge and they both will live happily ever after. Right?
</p>
<p>
	<i>
		<b>NO</b>
	</i>
</p>
<p>
	You see. Terry is a blind peice of fuck who can't fucking SEE shit, unless
	it uses 4 space indentation.
</p>
<p>
	He clones the repo, notices 2 spaces indentation and pukes his guts out
	before turning all the indentation to 4 spaces. (Every major IDE/Text editor
	has this feature).
</p>
<p>
	Now all he has to do is turn all the indentation to 2 spaces before
	submitting the PR. But doing this for every file is a pain in the ass. He
	just submits the PR with 4 spaces and invokes a war with Terry.
</p>
<p>This could've been avoided if both of them continued using tabs.</p>
<h2>The problem with tabs.</h2>
<p>
	Unlike you, some developers are quiet good at what they do. And some of them
	even documents their code with comments.
</p>
<p>
	A tab could be a different number of columns depending on your environment,
	but a space is always one column. In the documentation must line perfertly
	no matter what tab size you use. So, using space is the only good option
	here.
</p>
<p>Look at the code below</p>
<pre><code>/*
Name:       Greeter
Author:     ParaSpl01t
URL:        https://github.com/ParaSpl01t
LICENCE:    MIT
*/
function fuckOff(name) {
  return `Fuck off, ${name}!`;
}
document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = fuckOff("dave");</code></pre>
<p>
	This code uses 2 spaces for comment tabulation and will look good no matter
	what tab size you use.
</p>
<p>
	Now suppose the same code used tabs instead of spaces. This code is written
	by someone who uses tab size : 4.
</p>
<pre><code style="tab-size: 4;">/*
Name:		Fuck off
Author:		ParaSpl01t
URL:		https://github.com/ParaSpl01t
LICENCE:	MIT
*/
function fuckOff(name) {
	return `Fuck off, ${name}!`;
}
document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = fuckOff("dave");</code></pre>
<p>
	The code above looks fine and beautiful. But wait till someone who uses tab
	size : 2 opens this code.
</p>
<pre><code style="tab-size: 2;">/*
Name:		Fuck off
Author:		ParaSpl01t
URL:		https://github.com/ParaSpl01t
LICENCE:	MIT
*/
function fuckOff(name) {
	return `Fuck off, ${name}!`;
}
document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = fuckOff("dave");</code></pre>
<p>Looks ugly as fuck right?</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>Both have their own pros and cons but luckily there's a middleground.</p>
<p>
	Use tabs to indent the start of the line, one tab per indent level, and let
	everyone pick how wide they want that to be.
</p>
<p>
	Use spaces if you're lining up characters within a line, so they always line
	up regardless of tab size.
</p>
<p>
	Even though we can all use tabs for indentation and spaces for comments,
	There will always be atleast one sack of shit who will refuse to use this.
