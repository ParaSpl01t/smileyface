<p>
	Let's hope that I won't abandon this project like I've done with thousand
	others.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
	<strike>
		This site is built using a static site generator (SSG) which I haven't
		released yet. Heck I didn't even named it yet.
	</strike>
</p>
<p>
	The SSG is built using posix bash
	<strike>and can convert markdown into html</strike>. It used to support
	markdown but i decided to use plain html now. Before releasing this to
	public, I'm gonna implement various features like sitemap creation, search
	indexing, thumbnail resizer and SPA etc.
</p>
<p>
	The site template <strike>itself uses no js</strike> uses less than 1kb js
	for syntax highlighting and every line of css is hand-written.
</p>
<p>The design of the site will keep on improving and so will the SSG</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
	I created this site as a public devlog / personal diary. I don't have much
	expectations from this but I guess I'll see where this goes.

<p>
	<b>Update Feb 14, 2022 :</b> Smileyface now runs on GitHub actions. The
	paragraph you are reading right now, is written directly on github and built
	using smileyface on GitHub actions.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Update Feb 15, 2022 :</b> Created first usable GitHub actions release.
	With shit ton of bugs.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Update Feb 19, 2022 :</b>
	Released ParaSpl01t/smiley.sh@v0.0.2. Updating this page for testing.
