<h2>Why we need external link character anyway?</h2>
<p>
	External link icon (better known and used as "open in new tab icon") is used
	by almost every site, to let the users know that the link they are about to
	click, opens in a new tab.
</p>
<p>
	This shithole of a blog is under heavy development, and I'm constantly
	finding the most simple ways to make this blog more user friendly. I try to
	list all the things that pisses me off on the modern web, and try to
	implement the solutions on this site.
</p>
<p>
	One thing that makes me lose my fucking mind is when the web developer
	doesn't make the use of <kbd>target="_blank"</kbd> for opening the external
	links in new tab.
</p>
<p>
	If you're linking to something related to the topic in the middle of the
	article, make sure to open that in a seperate tab.
</p>
<p>
	Like bitch.. what the fuck? you just sent your visitor to another site,
	without even letting them read the entire god damn article.
</p>
<p>
	Foul language aside, I'm actually a good developer. Whenever there's a need
	to link to
	<a
		href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer"
		>something external</a
	>
	in the middle of the article, I make sure to open that in a new tab.
</p>
<p>
	For making this more user friendly, I decided to show an "external link"
	icon next to the links which uses <kbd>target="blank"</kbd> attribute.
</p>
<p>This is current hack/fuckery in pure CSS.</p>
<pre><code>a[target='_blank']::after {
	display: inline-flex;
	content: '';
	height: 8px;
	width: 8px;
	margin-left: 6px;
	vertical-align: middle;
	border: 4px solid;
	border-color: currentColor currentColor transparent transparent;
}</code></pre>
<p>
	This would've been simple, If there was a fucking character for it in the
	unicode. I would've just used that character instead of this border fuckery
	and saved a few	bytes of code + it would've looked good.
</p>
<h2>Why is there no external tab character in unicode?</h2>
<p>
	Before creating this horseshit of a hack/mess in my CSS, I was optimistic. I
	believed that a character for "external link" must exist among 144,697
	characters in unicode. Oh Boy was I wrong..
</p>
<p>
	There are literally fuck tons of useless characters in unicode. And somehow
	there is not a character as useful and widely used as this. While trying to
	find something that at-least resembles the "external link" icon, I found
	this article :
	<a
		href="https://dafoster.net/articles/2018/11/24/why-isnt-the-external-link-symbol-in-unicode/"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer"
		>Why isn't the external link symbol in Unicode?</a
	>
</p>
<p>
	<b>TLDR : </b> In 2006, Someone submitted a well written proposal to add an
	"external link" character to unicode. The proposal was ignored for 6 years
	and was finally rejected in 2012.
</p>
<p>
	Apperently the dicksuckers at unicode believe that "the external link icon
	is not an element of plain text". Bitch! emojis ain't an element of plain
	text either. But we still have them in unicode.
</p>
<p>
	How is "external link" different from something as useful as ©? I don't know
	who is person who rejected this proposal, but I'll assume that either
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		They are some old farts who have no idea about what the fuck is going on
		in this world.
	</li>
	<li>meth and cocaine.</li>
	<li>
		They are good for nothing Idiots who just want to watch the world burn.
	</li>
	<li>more meth and cocaine.</li>
</ul>
<p>or all of the above.</p>
<p>
	Go check the footer on
	<a
		href="https://home.unicode.org/"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer"
		>Unicode's homepage</a
	>. Faggots are literally using "↗" character as a substitue for external
	link character. I'm fucking done with these guys.
