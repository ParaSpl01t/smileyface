<h2>How it started?</h2>
<p>
	I wanted a static blog. Most static site generators are either a bit bloat
	or lack some features.
</p>
<p>
	So I decided to make a minimal but feature rich SSG from scratch. There were
	plenty of powerful programming languages to choose from like :
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Ruby</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>
	So I decided to use the one which will make me suffer the most. That's
	right..
	<b><i>BASH!</i></b>
</p>
<blockquote>Why bash?</blockquote>
<p>IDK, maybe because I like pain and suffering...</p>
<h2>Introducing smiley.sh</h2>
<p>
	So I released something useable on github called
	<a href="https://github.com/ParaSpl01t/smiley.sh" target="_blank"
		>smiley.sh</a
	>. It's under heavy development right now and I'll use this page as a
	changelog for the project.
</p>

	<br />

	right now, is written directly on github and built using smileyface on
	GitHub actions.
